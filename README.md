# Structural Thresholds of Irreversibility

This repository provides a canonical reference for a structural framework
describing irreversible thresholds in decision-making systems.

The work introduces the concept of a **structural knot**:
a threshold at which the space of possible actions is irreversibly transformed,
independently of individual intent or optimization capacity.

## Core Concepts

- **Structural threshold**  
  A system-level boundary beyond which prior decision frameworks no longer apply.

- **Structural knot**  
  The point at which irreversibility emerges as a property of the structure itself,
  not as the result of error, ignorance, or suboptimal choice.

- **Irreversibility as an emergent property**  
  Irreversibility arises from structural constraints and saturation,
  not from agent-based decision failure.
